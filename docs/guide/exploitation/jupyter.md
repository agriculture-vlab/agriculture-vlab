# AVL JupyterLab user guide

## Basic usage

This section provides a brief introduction for users to the basic features of
the JupyterLab environment as deployed on the AVL system. For more in-depth
documentation on the various components, see the links in the
[‘Further information’ section](#further-information).

### Logging in

🚧 **TODO TODO_PL** : update login procedure once Keycloak has been deployed 🚧

To log in, navigate to https://jupyter.agriculturevlab.eu/ with a web browser 
(a recent version of Firefox, Chrome, or Safari is recommended). Log-in is
currently managed via GitHub. On your first log-in you will be briefly
redirected to GitHub to authorize access and, if necessary, log in to your
GitHub account with your password. Subsequent log-ins will usually proceed
without this step. If your Jupyter server is not already running you may see
a progress bar appear for a few seconds while it is started for you. The
JupyterLab interface will then appear in your web browser, ready for use.

### Uploading data

JupyterLab runs remotely on an AVL server, and can work directly with files
stored in your user area on the server. To work with a file stored on your
local computer, you must first upload it to the server. You can do this by
clicking on the Upload (⇪) icon near the top left of the JupyterLab interface,
or simply by dragging the file from your file manager to the file list along
the left side of the JupyterLab interface. After upload the file will be
directly accessible in the notebook environment.

### Creating a notebook

You can create a new notebook from the JupyterLab File menu (File → New →
Notebook). If you are prompted to select a kernel, choose ‘Python 3 (ipykernel).
You can also create a notebook by clicking on the ‘Python 3 (ipykernel)’ icon
under the heading ‘Notebook’ in the JupyterLab launcher. The new notebook
will open in the main part of the JupyterLab interface with an empty input cell
at the top, ready for your first input to the Python interpreter.

### Importing Python libraries

The AVL Python environment includes a large number of preinstalled scientific
libraries to support common use cases in data processing and analysis of EO
and agricultural data. A brief list of these libraries can be found in the
[software reuse file](../../design/reuse.md#software-used-in-exploitation-subsystem)
for the exploitation subsystem. You can view a full and current list of 
installed packages in the notebook itself by entering this command into an
input cell in a notebook:

```
!conda list
```

Installed libraries can be imported using the standard Python `import` command.

If you require a library that isn’t already installed in AVL, please 
[contact AVL support](https://agriculturevlab.eu/index.php/interact/support/)
to request it; in most cases it’s quick and easy to add a new library to the
environment. This is the preferred method of adding libraries to AVL, but if
you require a library urgently, and if it's available in a conda channel such
as conda-forge, you can also install it yourself. For example, to install
a package called `example_package` from the `conda-forge` distribution
channel:

```
import sys
!mamba install --yes --channel conda-forge --prefix {sys.prefix} example_package
```

If a package is not available in any conda channel, it can also be installed
with pip:

```
import sys
!{sys.executable} -m pip install example_package
```

⚠ **Note:** pip installation should only be used if the package is not
available in a conda channel, since it can cause conflicts with the AVL’s
existing conda-based package management.

### Working with the Jupyter notebook

*For more information, see
[The JupyterLab Interface](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/interface.html)
in the JupyterLab documentation.*

The Jupyter scientific notebook combines features of an interactive terminal
environment (like, for instance, the bash or ipython shell) with features of a
programmer’s text editor. Within the notebook you can interact with the Python
environment by entering commands or expressions; your command history and the
associated output is stored and can be edited, re-run, rearranged, annotated,
saved, and shared.

You interact with a Jupyter notebook by typing or pasting an expression or
command into an input cell. When you press shift-enter or click the ▶ icon
above the notebook, the contents of the cell are evaluated by the Python
interpreter, and the result is displayed in a new cell below your input –
depending on the command this may be text, an image, or an interactive widget.
A new input cell is created below the displayed result, ready for your next
input.

By clicking the ▸▸ icon, you can run the entire notebook from start to finish
– not unlike a traditional Python script, but with the results from every
input cell evaluation interleaved into the notebook.

You can also comment and document your notebooks by including cells that
contain not Python code but Markdown source. Markdown is a simple markup
language which lets you add symbols to plain text to indicate common formatting
operations such as headings, bold or italic text, tables, and lists. In
addition to Markdown, you can include LaTeX-style mathematical formatting
by enclosing text between $ characters. To use an input cell for Markdown
rather than code, use the drop-down menu at the top of the notebook on the
right and change its setting from ‘Code’ to ‘Markdown’. After editing, press
shift-enter as for a code cell; for a Markdown cell the source text will be
hidden and the input cell will show the formatted Markdown until it is
opened for editing again.

### Saving results

The notebook can write to the server-side storage associated with your AVL
account, and any file writing functions in your Python code will write to
this area. The resulting files will appear in the file chooser in the left-hand
column of the  JupyterLab environment. For instance, the following code writes a
table to CSV and saves a PNG image of a graph:

```python
import numpy as np
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

table = np.transpose(np.array([np.arange(10), np.arange(10) ** 2]))
np.savetxt('table.csv', table, delimiter=',')
plt.plot(table[:,0], table[:,1])
plt.savefig('figure.png')
```

### Downloading results

Saved data files and figures – and the saved notebooks themselves – can be
downloaded to your local computer. Right-click on the file in the file chooser
at the left and select ‘Download’ from the context menu which appears.
Alternatively, select the file in the file chooser, open the ‘File’ menu from
the JupyterLab menu bar, and select ‘Download’.
