# About the Agriculture Virtual Laboratory

The Agriculture Virtual Laboratory (AVL) is a project initiated by the European
Space Agency with the goal of providing scientists with a community open science
tool to facilitate the development of expertise and knowledge in agricultural
monitoring and modelling based on evolving earth observation capabilities.

The Agriculture Virtual Laboratory strives to make an attractive offer to the
science community for implementing and executing end-to-end workflows with EO
data and derived products. Embracing open science principles, AVL enables
researchers to access, share, visualise, process and validate a variety of
relevant data sets. Moreover, algorithms and workflows developed within the
virtual laboratory may be published and shared, thus fostering collaboration at
all stages of research.

You can find more about the AVL project on the
