# Open Datasets

Besides the datasets that are searchable via the Dataset Explorer module, AVl has the possibility to give access to users to other open datasets.
These datasets can be mounted as repositories in the user workspace. Users can browse them and download items to their local workspace.

### Digital Earth Africa Cropland Extent Map (2019)
#### Source : Amazon Web Service
> **Description** : Digital Earth Africa's cropland extent map (2019) shows the estimated location of croplands in Africa for the period January to December 2019. Cropland is defined as: "a piece of land of minimum 0.01 ha (a single 10m x 10m pixel) that is sowed/planted and harvest-able at least once within the 12 months after the sowing/planting date." This definition will exclude non-planted grazing lands and perennial crops which can be difficult for satellite imagery to differentiate from natural vegetation. This provisional cropland extent map has a resolution of 10m, and was built using Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellite images from 2019. The cropland extent map was produced using extensive training data from regions across Africa, coupled with a Random Forest machine learning model. The continental service contains maps built separately for eight Agro-Ecological Zones (AEZs).

### Digital Earth Africa Fractional Cover
#### Source : Amazon Web Services
> **Description** : Fractional cover (FC) describes the landscape in terms of coverage by green vegetation, non-green vegetation (including deciduous trees during autumn, dry grass, etc.) and bare soil. It provides insight into how areas of dry vegetation and/or bare soil and green vegetation are changing over time. The product is derived from Landsat satellite data, using an algorithm developed by the Joint Remote Sensing Research Program. Digital Earth Africa's FC service has two components. Fractional Cover is estimated from each Landsat scene, providing measurements from individual days. Fractional Cover Annual Summary (Percentiles) provides 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles estimated independently for the green vegetation, non-green vegetation, and bare soil fractions observed in each calendar year (1st of January - 31st December). While the scene based Fractional Cover can be used to study dynamic processes, the annual summaries make it easier to analyse year to year changes. The percentiles provide robust estimates of the low, median and high proportion values observed for each cover type in a year, which can be used to characterise the land cover.

### Digital Earth Africa Landsat Collection 2 Level 2
#### Source : Amazon Web Services
> **Description** : Digital Earth Africa (DE Africa) provides free and open access to a copy of Landsat Collection 2 Level-2 products over Africa. These products are produced and provided by the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The Landsat series of Earth Observation satellites, jointly led by USGS and NASA, have been continuously acquiring images of the Earth’s land surface since 1972. DE Africa provides data from Landsat 5, 7 and 8 satellites, including historical observations dating back to late 1980s and regularly updated new acquisitions. New Level-2 Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 data are available after 15 to 27 days from acquisition. See Landsat Collection 2 Generation Timeline for details. USGS Landsat Collection 2 was released early 2021 and offers improved processing, geometric accuracy, and radiometric calibration compared to previous Collection 1 products. The Level-2 products are endorsed by the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) to be Analysis Ready Data for Land (CARD4L)-compliant.

### Digital Earth Africa Sentinel-1 RTC
#### Source : Amazon Web Services
> **Description** : DE Africa’s Sentinel-1 backscatter product is developed to be compliant with the CEOS Analysis Ready Data for Land (CARD4L) specifications. The Sentinel-1 mission, composed of a constellation of two C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellites, are operated by European Space Agency (ESA) as part of the Copernicus Programme. The mission currently collects data every 12 days over Africa at a spatial resolution of approximately 20 m. Radar backscatter measures the amount of microwave radiation reflected back to the sensor from the ground surface. This measurement is sensitive to surface roughness, moisture content and viewing geometry. DE Africa provides Sentinel-1 backscatter as Radiometrically Terrain Corrected (RTC) gamma-0 (γ0) where variation due to changing observation geometries has been mitigated. The dual polarisation backcastter time series can be used in applications for forests, agriculture, wetlands and land cover classification. SAR’s ability to ‘see through’ clouds makes it critical for mapping and monitoring land cover changes in the wet tropics.

> **Description** : The ALOS/PALSAR annual mosaic is a global 25 m resolution dataset that combines data from many images captured by JAXA’s PALSAR and PALSAR-2 sensors on ALOS-1 and ALOS-2 satellites respectively. This product contains radar measurement in L-band and in HH and HV polarizations. It has a spatial resolution of 25 m and is available annually for 2007 to 2010 (ALOS/PALSAR) and 2015 to 2020 (ALOS-2/PALSAR-2). The JERS annual mosaic is generated from images acquired by the SAR sensor on the Japanese Earth Resources Satellite-1 (JERS-1) satellite. This product contains radar measurement in L-band and HH polarization. It has a spatial resolution of 25 m and is available for 1996. This mosaic data is part of a global dataset provided by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) Earth Observation Research Center.

### Digital Earth Africa WOFS
#### Source : Amazon Web Services
> **Description** : Water Observations from Space (WOfS) is a service that draws on satellite imagery to provide historical surface water observations of the whole African continent. WOfS allows users to understand the location and movement of inland and coastal water present in the African landscape. It shows where water is usually present; where it is seldom observed; and where inundation of the surface has been observed by satellite. They are generated using the WOfS classification algorithm on Landsat satellite data.
