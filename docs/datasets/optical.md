### ADEOS-1
#### Source : FedEO (NASA_CMR)
> **Description** : In Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR), a short pulse of coherent light generated by a laser (Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation) is transmitted in a narrow beam to illuminate corner cube retroreflectors on the satellite. The return signal, typically a few photons, is collected by a telescope and the time-of-flight is measured. Using information about the satellite's orbit, the time-of-flight, and the speed of light, the location of the ranging station can be determined. Similar data acquired by another station, many kilometers distant from the first, or on a different continent, can be used to determine the distance between stations to precisions of centimeters or better. Repetitive measurements over months and years yield the change in distance, or the motion of the Earth's crust.

### ALOS
#### Source : FedEO (JAXA_CATS-I)
> **Description** : The PALSAR-2 aboard the ALOS-2 is a Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), which emits microwave and receives the reflection from the ground to acquire information. Since it does not need other sources of light such as the sun, SAR has the advantage of providing satellite images regardless day or night. The frequency of transmitting and receiving microwave is L-band, which is less affected by clouds and rains. This all-weather observing capability is suitable for monitoring disasters rapidly. In addition, L-band microwave can reach to the ground partially penetrating through vegetation to obtain information of vegetation and ground surface. ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 will have a spotlight mode (1m*3m resolution in azimuth*range direction), whilst ALOS/PALSAR has a 10 m resolution. It will allow comprehensive monitoring of disasters by providing users with more detailed data than ALOS/PALSAR. The observation repetition frequency of ALOS-2 was improved by expanding the observable range of the satellite up to about 3 times (from 870km to 2,320km), as well as giving ALOS-2 a right-and-left looking function, which was not available on ALOS.

#### Source : FedEO (NASA_CMR)
> **Description** : This dataset provides an ecosystem type map at 12.5 meter pixel spacing and 0.2 ha minimum mapping unit for the area surrounding Great Slave Lake, Northwest Territories, Canada for the time period 1997 to 2011. The map includes nine classes for peatland, wetland, and upland areas derived from a Random Forest classification trained on multi-date, multi-sensor remote sensing images across the study extent, and using field data and high-resolution Worldview-2 image interpretation for training and validation. The nine classes are: Water, Marsh, Swamp, Open Fen, Treed Fen, Bog, Upland Deciduous, Upland Conifer, and Sparsely Vegetated. A tenth map class identifies areas of historical fires (prior to 2011) that are currently undergoing post-fire successional revegetation. This dataset provides an ecosystem type map of the area before the large fire season of 2014 to better understand the effects of fires in the area.

#### Source : FedEO (TropForest)
> **Description** : The objective of the ESA TropForest project was to create a harmonised geo-database of ready-to-use satellite imagery to support 2010 global forest assessment performed by the Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European Commission and by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Assessments for year 2010 were essential for building realistic deforestation benchmark rates at global to regional levels. To reach this objective, the project aimed to create a harmonised ortho-rectified/pre-processed imagery geo-database based on satellite data acquisitions (ALOS AVNIR-2, DEIMOS-1 SLIM6, KOMPSAT-2 MSC) performed during year 2009 and 2010, for the Tropical Latin America (excluding Mexico) and for the Tropical South and Southeast Asia (excluding China), resulting in 1971 sites located at 1 deg x 1 deg geographical lat/long intersections. The project finally delivered 1866 sites (94.7% of target) due to cloud coverages too high for missing sites

#### Source : FedEO (NASA_CMR)
> **Description** : This data set, as part of the NASA Making Earth System Data Records for Use in Research Environments (MEaSUREs) Program, combines interferometric phases from multiple satellite interferometric synthetic-aperture radar systems to derive the first comprehensive phase-based map of Antarctic ice velocity. The precision in ice speed and flow direction over 80% of Antarctica is better than prior mappings based on feature and speckle tracking by a factor of 10. Phase-derived velocity mostly covers the years between 2007 and 2018, while tracking-derived velocity (for regions along the coasts) is mostly found in the years from 2013 to 2017. Additional data acquired between 1996 and 2018 were used as needed to maximize coverage. See &lt;a href='https://nsidc.org/data/measures/aiv'&gt;Antarctic Ice Sheet Velocity and Mapping Data&lt;/a&gt; for related data.

### BIROS
#### Source : FedEO (EOWEB)
> **Description** : The FireBIRD mission consists of two small satellites, TET-1 and BIROS. Together, the two satellites are on an Earth observation mission that aims to detect forest fires, or high-temperature events, from space. The new infrared system provides high-quality data that is capable of measuring the spread of the fire and the amount of heat generated with great accuracy very early on - almost in real time - meaning that FireBIRD can serve as an early warning system. The data acquired from this Earth observation mission can also be used as a basis for scientific climate research. In addition to the main payload of the cameras, further experiments have been planned for developing the technology on board the small satellites. Further information can be found on the following website: http://www.dlr.de/firebird/en/ and in the FireBIRD brochure available at: http://www.dlr.de/firebird/en/Portaldata/79/Resources/dokumente/FireBIRD_Broschuere_HighRes_v3_english.pdf

### Beijing-1
#### Source : FedEO (NASA_CMR)
> **Description** : On the background of these requirements for sensor calibration, intercalibration and product validation, the subgroup on Calibration and Validation of the Committee on Earth Observing System (CEOS) formulated the following recommendation during the plenary session held in China at the end of 2004, with the goal of setting-up and operating an internet based system to provide sensor data, protocols and guidelines for these purposes:Background:Reference Datasets are required to support the understanding of climate change and quality assure operational services by Earth Observing satellites. The data from different sensors and the resulting synergistic data products require a high level of accuracy that can only be obtained through continuous traceable calibration and validation activities.Requirement:Initiate an activity to document a reference methodology to predict Top of Atmosphere (TOA) radiance for which currently flying and planned wide swath sensors can be intercompared, i.e. define a standard for traceability. Also create and maintain a fully accessible web page containing, on an instrument basis, links to all instrument characteristics needed for intercomparisons as specified above, ideally in a common format. In addition, create and maintain a database (e.g. SADE) of instrument data for specific vicarious calibration sites, including site characteristics, in a common format. Each agency is responsible for providing data for their instruments in this common format. Recommendation : The required activities described above should be supported for an implementation period of two years and a maintenance period over two subsequent years. The CEOS should encourage a member agency to accept the lead role in supporting this activity. CEOS should request all member agencies to support this activity by providing appropriate information and data in a timely manner.Pseudo-Invariant Calibration Sites (PICS):Algeria 3 is one of six CEOS reference Pseudo-Invariant Calibration Sites (PICS) that are CEOS Reference Test Sites. Besides the nominally good site characteristics (temporal stability, uniformity, homogeneity, etc.), these six PICS were selected by also taking into account their heritage and the large number of datasets from multiple instruments that already existed in the EO archives and the long history of characterization performed over these sites. The PICS have high reflectance and are usually made up of sand dunes with climatologically low aerosol loading and practically no vegetation. Consequently, these PICS can be used to evaluate the long-term stability of instrument and facilitate inter-comparison of multiple instruments.

### FireBIRD
#### Source : FedEO (EOWEB)
> **Description** : The FireBIRD mission consists of two small satellites, TET-1 and BIROS. Together, the two satellites are on an Earth observation mission that aims to detect forest fires, or high-temperature events, from space. The new infrared system provides high-quality data that is capable of measuring the spread of the fire and the amount of heat generated with great accuracy very early on - almost in real time - meaning that FireBIRD can serve as an early warning system. The data acquired from this Earth observation mission can also be used as a basis for scientific climate research. In addition to the main payload of the cameras, further experiments have been planned for developing the technology on board the small satellites. Further information can be found on the following website: http://www.dlr.de/firebird/en/ and in the FireBIRD brochure available at: http://www.dlr.de/firebird/en/Portaldata/79/Resources/dokumente/FireBIRD_Broschuere_HighRes_v3_english.pdf

The EO-1 mission validated highly integrated multispectral data from the Advanced Land Imager (ALI) sensor and hyperspectral imaging data from the Hyperion sensor. After the initial technology mission was accomplished, NASA and the USGS agreed to continue the EO-1 program due to high interest in the specialized data from scientific communities. 

EO-1 Data products consist of imagery collected during the original one-year mission, as well as more recent Data Acquisition Requests (DARs) from the EO-1 Extended Mission. EO-1 scenes are processed to Level 1Gst (L1Gst) and images with adequate ground control points are processed to Level 1T (L1T). L1Gst and L1T products are provided in GeoTIFF format. Scenes that have been processed to L1T are also available as Full Resolution Browse and GIS Ready Bundle products in JPEG format. Level 1R (L1R) products in HDF format are only available for Hyperion data.

> **Description** : ESA maintains an archive of IKONOS Geo Ortho Kit data previously requested through the TPM scheme and acquired between 2000 and 2008, over Europe, North Africa and the Middle East. The imagery products gathered from IKONOS are categorised according to positional accuracy, which is determined by the reliability of an object in the image to be within the specified accuracy of the actual location of the object on the ground. Within each IKONOS-derived product, location error is defined by a circular error at 90% confidence (CE90), which means that locations of objects are represented on the image within the stated accuracy 90% of the time. There are six levels of IKONOS imagery products, determined by the level of positional accuracy: Geo, Standard Ortho, Reference, Pro, Precision and PrecisionPlus. The product provided by ESA to Category-1 users is the Geo Ortho Kit, consisting of IKONOS Black-and-White images with radiometric and geometric corrections (1-metre pixels, CE90=15 metres) bundled with IKONOS multispectral images with absolute radiometry (4-metre pixels, CE90=50 metres). IKONOS collects 1m and 4m Geo Ortho Kit imagery (nominally at nadir 0.82m for panchromatic image, 3.28m for multispectral mode) at an elevation angle between 60 and 90 degrees. To increase the positional accuracy of the final orthorectified imagery, customers should select imagery with IKONOS elevation angle between 72 and 90 degrees. The Geo Ortho Kit is tailored for sophisticated users such as photogrammetrists who want to control the orthorectification process. Geo Ortho Kit images include the camera geometry obtained at the time of image collection. Applying Geo Ortho Kit imagery, customers can produce their own highly accurate orthorectified products by using commercial off the shelf software, digital elevation models (DEMs) and optional ground control.

Field data were collected during July 8-17, 2016 to parameterize and to validate the derived permafrost maps. The YKD is in the sporadic to isolated permafrost zone where permafrost forms extensive elevated plateaus on abandoned floodplains. The region is extremely flat and vulnerable to eustatic sea-level rise and inland storm surges. These high-resolution permafrost maps support landscape change analyses and assessments of the impacts of climate change on permafrost in this region of high biological productivity, critical wildlife habitats, and subsistence-based human economy.

### JERS-1
#### Source : EO-CAT (OPS)
> **Description** : The JERS-1 Optical System (OPS) is composed of a Very Near Infrared Radiometer (VNIR) and a Short Wave Infrared Radiometer (SWIR). The instrument has 8 observable spectral bands from visible to short wave infrared. Data acquired by ESA ground stations  The JERS-1 OPS products are available in GeoTIFF format. These products are available only for the VNIR sensor. All four bands are corrected. The correction consists in a vertical and horizontal destriping, the radiometry values are expanded from the range [0,63] to the range [0,255]. No geometrical correction is applied on level 1. The pixel size of approximately 18 x 24.2 metres for raw data is newly dimensioned to 18 x 18 metres for System Corrected data using a cubic convolution algorithm.  Disclaimer: Cloud coverage for JERS OPS products has not been computed using an algorithm. The cloud cover assignment was performed manually by operators at the acquisition stations. Due to missing attitude information, the Nadir looking band (band 3) and the corresponding forward looking band (band 4) are not well coregistered, resulting in some accuracy limitations. The quality control was not performed systematically for each frame. A subset of the entire JERS Optical dataset was selected and manually checked. As a result of this, users may occasionally encounter issues with some of the individual products.

#### Source : FedEO (NASA_CMR)
> **Description** : On the background of these requirements for sensor calibration, intercalibration and product validation, the subgroup on Calibration and Validation of the Committee on Earth Observing System (CEOS) formulated the following recommendation during the plenary session held in China at the end of 2004, with the goal of setting-up and operating an internet based system to provide sensor data, protocols and guidelines for these purposes:Background:Reference Datasets are required to support the understanding of climate change and quality assure operational services by Earth Observing satellites. The data from different sensors and the resulting synergistic data products require a high level of accuracy that can only be obtained through continuous traceable calibration and validation activities.Requirement:Initiate an activity to document a reference methodology to predict Top of Atmosphere (TOA) radiance for which currently flying and planned wide swath sensors can be intercompared, i.e. define a standard for traceability. Also create and maintain a fully accessible web page containing, on an instrument basis, links to all instrument characteristics needed for intercomparisons as specified above, ideally in a common format. In addition, create and maintain a database (e.g. SADE) of instrument data for specific vicarious calibration sites, including site characteristics, in a common format. Each agency is responsible for providing data for their instruments in this common format. Recommendation : The required activities described above should be supported for an implementation period of two years and a maintenance period over two subsequent years. The CEOS should encourage a member agency to accept the lead role in supporting this activity. CEOS should request all member agencies to support this activity by providing appropriate information and data in a timely manner.Pseudo-Invariant Calibration Sites (PICS):Algeria 3 is one of six CEOS reference Pseudo-Invariant Calibration Sites (PICS) that are CEOS Reference Test Sites. Besides the nominally good site characteristics (temporal stability, uniformity, homogeneity, etc.), these six PICS were selected by also taking into account their heritage and the large number of datasets from multiple instruments that already existed in the EO archives and the long history of characterization performed over these sites. The PICS have high reflectance and are usually made up of sand dunes with climatologically low aerosol loading and practically no vegetation. Consequently, these PICS can be used to evaluate the long-term stability of instrument and facilitate inter-comparison of multiple instruments.

### MODIS-BURN-M
#### Source : USGS
> **Description** : The Terra and Aqua combined MCD64A1 Burned Area data product is a monthly, Level 3 gridded 500 meter product containing per-pixel burning and quality information.  The MCD64A1 mapping approach employs 500 meter MODIS Surface Reflectance imagery coupled with 1 kilometer MODIS active fire observations.  The algorithm uses a burn sensitive vegetation index (VI) to create dynamic thresholds that are applied to the composite imagery.  The VI is derived from MODIS short-wave infrared atmospherically corrected surface reflectance bands 5 and 7 with a measure of temporal texture.  The algorithm ultimately identifies the date of burn for the 500 meter grid cells within each individual MODIS tile.

#### Source : FedEO (NASA_CMR)
> **Description** : On the background of these requirements for sensor calibration, intercalibration and product validation, the subgroup on Calibration and Validation of the Committee on Earth Observing System (CEOS) formulated the following recommendation during the plenary session held in China at the end of 2004, with the goal of setting-up and operating an internet based system to provide sensor data, protocols and guidelines for these purposes:Background:Reference Datasets are required to support the understanding of climate change and quality assure operational services by Earth Observing satellites. The data from different sensors and the resulting synergistic data products require a high level of accuracy that can only be obtained through continuous traceable calibration and validation activities.Requirement:Initiate an activity to document a reference methodology to predict Top of Atmosphere (TOA) radiance for which currently flying and planned wide swath sensors can be intercompared, i.e. define a standard for traceability. Also create and maintain a fully accessible web page containing, on an instrument basis, links to all instrument characteristics needed for intercomparisons as specified above, ideally in a common format. In addition, create and maintain a database (e.g. SADE) of instrument data for specific vicarious calibration sites, including site characteristics, in a common format. Each agency is responsible for providing data for their instruments in this common format. Recommendation : The required activities described above should be supported for an implementation period of two years and a maintenance period over two subsequent years. The CEOS should encourage a member agency to accept the lead role in supporting this activity. CEOS should request all member agencies to support this activity by providing appropriate information and data in a timely manner.Pseudo-Invariant Calibration Sites (PICS):Algeria 3 is one of six CEOS reference Pseudo-Invariant Calibration Sites (PICS) that are CEOS Reference Test Sites. Besides the nominally good site characteristics (temporal stability, uniformity, homogeneity, etc.), these six PICS were selected by also taking into account their heritage and the large number of datasets from multiple instruments that already existed in the EO archives and the long history of characterization performed over these sites. The PICS have high reflectance and are usually made up of sand dunes with climatologically low aerosol loading and practically no vegetation. Consequently, these PICS can be used to evaluate the long-term stability of instrument and facilitate inter-comparison of multiple instruments.

Unlike many other navigation systems, DORIS is based on an uplink device. The receivers are on board the satellite with the transmitters are on the ground. This creates a centralized system in which the complete set of observations is downloaded by the satellite to the ground center, from where they are distributed after editing and processing. An accurate measurment is made of the Doppler shift on radiofrequency signals emitted by the ground beacons and received on the spacecraft.

> **Description** : LAI was defined by Committee of the Earth Observation System (CEOS) as half the developed area of the convex hull wrapping the green canopy elements per unit horizontal ground. This definition allows accounting for elements which are not flat such as needles or stems. LAI is strongly non linearly related to reflectance. Therefore, its estimation from remote sensing observations will be scale dependant over heterogeneous landscapes. When observing a canopy made of different layers of vegetation, it is therefore mandatory to consider all the green layers. This is particularly important for forest canopies where the understory may represent a very significant contribution to the total canopy LAI. The derived LAI corresponds therefore to the total green LAI, including the contribution of the green elements of the understory. The resulting SENTNEL LAI products are relatively consistent with the actual LAI for low LAI values and Ã¢&#128;&#152;non-forestÃ¢&#128;&#153; surfaces; while for forests, particularly for needle leaf types, significant departures with the true LAI are expected.

> **Description** : '''Short description:''' Altimeter satellite gridded Sea Level Anomalies (SLA) computed with respect to a twenty-year [1993, 2012] mean. The SLA is estimated by Optimal Interpolation, merging the measurement from the different altimeter missions available (see QUID document or http://duacs.cls.fr [http://duacs.cls.fr] pages for processing details). The product gives additional variables (i.e. Absolute Dynamic Topography and geostrophic currents (absolute and anomalies)).This product is processed by the DUACS multimission altimeter data processing system. It serves in near-real time the main operational oceanography and climate forecasting centers in Europe and worldwide. It processes data from all altimeter missions: Jason-3, Sentinel-3A, HY-2A, Saral/AltiKa, Cryosat-2, Jason-2, Jason-1, T/P, ENVISAT, GFO, ERS1/2. It provides a consistent and homogeneous catalogue of products for varied applications, both for near real time applications and offline studies. To produce maps of Sea Level Anomalies (SLA) and Absolute Dynamic Topography (ADT) in delayed-time (REPROCESSED), the system uses the along-track altimeter missions from products called SEALEVEL*_PHY_L3_REP_OBSERVATIONS_008_*. Finally an Optimal Interpolation is made merging all the flying satellites in order to compute gridded SLA and ADT. The geostrophic currents are derived from sla (geostrophic velocities anomalies, ugosa and vgosa variables) and from adt (absolute geostrophic velicities, ugos and vgos variables). Note that the gridded products can be visualized on the LAS (Live Access Data) Aviso+ web page (http://www.aviso.altimetry.fr/en/data/data-access/las-live-access-server.html [http://www.aviso.altimetry.fr/en/data/data-access/las-live-access-server.html])

### Sentinel-3A
#### Source : FedEO (NASA_CMR)
> **Description** : Doppler Orbitography by Radiopositioning Integrated on Satellite (DORIS) Cumulative Station Position Product from the NASA Crustal Dynamics Data Information System (CDDIS). DORIS is a dual-frequency Doppler system consisting of a receiver flying aboard a satellite and a globally distributed network of ground beacons. The DORIS receiver on-board the orbiting satellite tracks the dual-frequency radio signals transmitted by the network of ground beacons and generates the DORIS data. A measurement is made of either the Doppler shift or absolute phase as the satellite’s orbit moves over the ground-based beacon. DORIS data records contain a time-tagged range-rate measurement with associated ancillary information. DORIS observations from a global network can be utilized for a variety of products. Analysis Centers (ACs) of the International DORIS Service (IDS) retrieve DORIS data on a regular basis to compute station position solutions for the DORIS beacons supporting the IDS network. The IDS Analysis Center Coordinator combines these individual AC solutions to generate a long-term DORIS position and velocity cumulative solution through a piecewise linear (position+velocity) model to describe the station motions. The cumulative position and velocity solution is obtained from the stacking of the weekly solution files and is then aligned to the current ITRF. The residuals of this stacking are of particular interest since they depict non-linear station motions.

### Sentinel-3B
#### Source : FedEO (NASA_CMR)
> **Description** : Doppler Orbitography by Radiopositioning Integrated on Satellite (DORIS) Data (multi-day files) from the NASA Crustal Dynamics Data Information System (CDDIS). DORIS is a dual-frequency Doppler system consisting of a receiver flying aboard a satellite and a globally distributed network of ground beacons. The DORIS receiver on-board the orbiting satellite tracks the dual-frequency radio signals transmitted by the network of ground beacons and generates the DORIS data. A measurement is made of either the Doppler shift or absolute phase as the satellite’s orbit moves over the ground-based beacon. DORIS data records contain a time-tagged range-rate measurement with associated ancillary information. The data records also contain information about any corrections that may have been applied during the processing phase, such as for the ionosphere, troposphere, and satellite center of mass, among others. Furthermore, meteorological measurements (e.g., temperature, relative humidity, ground pressure) recorded by instruments co-located with the ground-based beacons are included with the DORIS data and can be used to determine the tropospheric correction. DORIS data in the original format are also supplied to the data center in multi-day files, corresponding to the mission’s data processing arc, and are forwarded approximately 20 days after the end of the last observation day contained in the file. More information about these data is available on the CDDIS website at https://cddis.nasa.gov/Data_and_Derived_Products/DORIS/DORIS_data_holdings.html.

> **Description** : This dataset provides estimated solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) of specific vegetation types and total SIF under clear-sky and real/cloudy conditions at a resolution of 4 km for the Midwest USA. The estimates are 8-day averaged daily means over the 2018 crop growing season for the time period 2018-05-01 to 2018-09-29. SIF of a specific vegetation type (i.e., corn, soybean, grass/pasture, forest) was expressed as the product of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by the canopy (fPAR), and canopy SIF yield (SIFyield) for each vegetation type. Uncertainty of each variable was also calculated and is provided. These components of the SIF model were derived using a TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) dataset, the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service Cropland Data Layer, and the MODIS MCD15A2H 8-day 500 m fPAR product. These data could be used to improve estimates of vegetation productivity and vegetation stress.

### VIIRS
#### Source : USGS
> **Description** : The Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership (S-NPP) NASA Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Vegetation Indices (VI) Version 1 data products characterize land surface vegetation and related parameters. The VNP13 data products are designed after the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Terra and Aqua Vegetation Indices product suite to promote the continuity of the Earth Observation System (EOS) mission. These products are designed to enhance the vegetation reflected signal from measured spectral responses by making use of the distinctive soil-vegetation characteristic in the red-edge area of the spectrum. Vegetation indices combine two or more spectral bands in the red (0.6 - 0.7 micrometer), NIR wavelengths (0.7-1.1 micrometer), and Blue (0.44-0.5 micrometer) regions. The VNP13 algorithm process produces three vegetation indices: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), and Enhanced Vegetation Index-2 (EVI2). These products inform us about the status of vegetation health during the growing season and as it changes in response to environmental, climate, and anthropogenic drivers.

Validation at stage 1 has been achieved for the VIIRS Vegetation Index (VI) product suite.
