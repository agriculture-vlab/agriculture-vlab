This section describes the system design of the technical system developed and
operated for the Agricultural Virtual Laboratory. It comprises two main building
blocks, mainly the Thematic processing subsystem and the Exploitation subsystem,
which are based on two existing software packages, TAO and xcube, respectively.
AVL ingests various data sets either from data archives stored in repositories
or from data portal services like Sentinel Hub or geoDB. Users are provided with
individual workspaces and have the choice between different interfaces: a
Jupyter Lab environment, and the interface to the thematic processing subsystem.

The system design documentation consists of three parts, describing the design
of the thematic processing subsystem, the exploitation subsystem, and the
test procedures.

1. [Processing system](processing/index.md)
2. [Exploitation system](exploitation/index.md)
3. [Test procedures and results](testing/index.md)
