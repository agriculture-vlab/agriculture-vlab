## The JupyterLab environment

The Jupyter framework, with its JupyterLab user interface, provides a Python
scientific computing environment in the form of a user-friendly, web-based
interactive scientific notebook. Fundamentally, interaction is based on the
classic *read-eval-print loop* model: the user types a command or expression;
the system reads the input, evaluates the expression, and displays the output.
The system then returns to the start of the loop, waiting for the next user
input to be read and evaluated. Jupyter builds extensively on this
well-established interaction paradigm, assembling the sequence of user inputs
and system outputs into a persistent web-based document â€“ a scientific notebook
â€“ which can be edited, rearranged, saved, shared, and exported to a variety of
formats. Inputs and outputs are by no means restricted to text: system outputs
can be embedded in the notebook as images or interactive graphical widgets, and
GUI libraries can also be used to incorporate graphical input widgets in
addition to the standard textual input boxes. Furthermore, the inputs and
outputs can be freely interleaved with documentation written in the intuitive
Markdown format, making a Jupyter notebook suitable not only for scientific
exploration and software development, but also documentation, presentation, and
teaching.
